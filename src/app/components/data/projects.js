    description:
      "A full-stack flight discovery app that makes travel planning easy and smart. FlightFinder uses real-world datasets, including Goibibo flights, airport codes, and COâ‚‚ emissions. On the frontend, it calculates carbon emissions based on flight class and distance, helping users track environmental impact. The app also shows flight price history, applies randomized discounts for testing, and supports nearby airport search and airline logo matching. MongoDB stores all data, while Node.js and Express handle APIs. React creates a dynamic UI, Redux manages state efficiently, and Framer Motion adds smooth animations for a clean, interactive experience.",
